        <h1>Background</h1>
        <p>My name is Esther. I’ve been working as an architectural designer for the past three years, but starting this Fall, I’ll officially transition into Human-Computer Interaction. This class is the start of this new journey. After I graduate, I hope to be a part of the development of smart cities.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Before COVID 19, I loved exploring a new place, from a local café to a different country. But, due to COVID 19, I’ve been taking a break from it. Now, I’ve been trying to find more things to do at home, such as baking and cooking. I’ve made pound cakes, cheesecakes, and cookies so far.
