Esther Cho07-20-22Week 1 – Assignment 11. My name is Esther. I’ve been working as an architectural designer for the past three years, but starting this Fall, I’ll officially transition into Human-Computer Interaction. This class is the start of this new journey. After I graduate, I hope to be a part of the development of smart cities. Before COVID 19, I loved exploring a new place, from a local café to a different country. But, due to COVID 19, I’ve been taking a break from it. Now, I’ve been trying to find more things to do at home, such as baking and cooking. I’ve made pound cakes, cheesecakes, and cookies so far. Currently, my favorite food is sushi roll, especially from Shoyou Sushi. I also enjoy other types of Asian cuisine, such as Korean and Thai. I enjoy Korean soups and traditional dishes. My favorite Thai food is Pad Thai. For fruits, I love all berries. I like to eat them fresh or in smoothies. In terms of drinks, I probably drink tea and coffee most of the time. My favorite ice cream is pistachio. It has been my favorite since I was little.
